Counting sort time complexity 0(n) and space complexity 0(n + (n+1) + n).
Heap sort time complexity 0(n log n) and space complexity 0(n).

Counting sort is not perfect for negative numbers. and it is space complexity is very bad.

Heap sort uses heapify algorithm. Heapify algorithm time complexity 0(log n).
Heap sort call n time heapify function that's why it is the time complexity 0(n log n) and space complexity 0(n).
It sorts any type of data negative or positive

That's why HeapSort is more efficient than counting sort.
