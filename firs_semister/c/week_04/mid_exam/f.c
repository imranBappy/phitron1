/*
Good numbers are the positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the good digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 4747, 74, 4 are good and 5, 157, 4657 are not.

Unfortunately, not all numbers are good. Petya calls a number nearly good if the number of good digits in it is a good number. He wonders whether number n is a nearly good number.
