"""
Definition of the Observer:

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets us define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

Explanation of my code:
I have done the same things in the above code, I have created two class Subscriber and User. And in Subscriber class I made few method like subscribe and unsubscribe for take user subscription. Also subscribe_channel_name and unsubscribe_channel_name for making channel. Also sub_notify() and unsub_notify() for notified Subscription user and Unsubscription user. 

And in User class I made two method like subs_cribe() and unsubs_cribe() for give update a user. 

And lastly I have created people object for Subscriper class, and some more object for User class.
