manage every file, that’s why we can’t make same name folder or file in the same folder.
If operation system give us to create same name folder in same folder , then how could we find out a specific file or folder, it could be messy situation. We may not able to delete or view a significant file, it would be took more time to handle, that’s why we can’t can’t create same name file in a same folder, But we can creat same name file in various folder, because we all know file path is always unique. So that is the things, the operating system manage the file and folder, and through this process we can maintain our work.
